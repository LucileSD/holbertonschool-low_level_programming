0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
mandatory
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
mandatory
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf (You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first and make sure you understand the slides: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops”.)
Keywords and identifiers

ascii (You do not need to learn about scanf, getc, getchar, EOF, EXIT_SUCCESS, time, rand, srand, RAND_MAX, for loops, do...while loops, functions.)
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
What the the relational operators and how to use them
What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
What are the boolean operators and how to use them
How to use the if, if ... else statements
How to use comments
How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
How to assign values to variables
How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
How to use the while loop
How to use variables with the while loop
How to print variables using printf
What is the ASCII character set
What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
You are not allowed to use system
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
